"Hello. The main purpose of Crediflow is to provide a platform where Creators can receive recognition for their work and Admirers can show appreciation and support through tipping.

Now, let's sign up. First, let's try throwing a tip as an Admirer by obtaining an NFT.

We load the registered Crediflow and can see its Creator. We also load the NFT holder and perform an ""Admirer Mint.""

Before execution, let's check the number of NFTs to make it clear that it will increase later.

Let's send the transaction. After that, we press the ""Load"" button, and we can see that we have become an NFT holder.

Let's also check the contract event.

Let's check the account's Flow balance and try to tip 95 FLOW. We send the transaction.

Let's also check the contract event. The balance has been properly reduced.",01.mp3
"Next, let's try getting an NFT and claiming it as a Creator. First, let's perform a ""Creator Mint"" from the registered Crediflow where we are registered as a Creator.

Let's send the transaction. After that, we press the ""Load"" button, and we can see that we have become an NFT holder.

Let's also check the contract event. The number of NFTs we own has increased.

Now, let's ""Claim"" it. The current Flow balance is 800. We send the transaction to ""Claim.""

Let's check the contract event, and the balance has increased by 200 FLOW.",02.mp3
"Finally, as a host, Crediflow can register itself with its own account.

If you enter the address of the account you want to view in the ""Host"" section and load it, you can see the registered Crediflow.

Let's create our own Crediflow for this recording. We press ""Create Own Crediflow"" and send the transaction.

Let's check the contract event. After reloading, ""Recording Test"" has been registered!

And that's it! Thank you for watching!",03.mp3
