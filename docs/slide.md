# The Problem

> The workers who make the Japanese shows the world is binge-watching can earn as little as $200 a month. Many wonder how much longer they can endure it.

# Desired User Experience: Admirer

* Holding proof of having tipped a beloved work
* Sending tips to individual creators or groups of creators

---

# Side: Admirer Examples

* Sending tips to junior creators who worked on a minor work "A"

*We aim to express our passion for a work not only through tipping, but also by sending tips via end credits to creators or groups of creators, providing a more meaningful experience than a typical tipping system.

# Desired User Experience: Creator

* Holding proof of participation and contribution to a work (including anonymous contributions)
* Receiving tips via the creator NFTs

---

# Side: Creator Examples

* Ability to claim tips from passionate fans who were involved in a work during their junior years, at any time for financial gain

*Until claimed, tips should not be considered as personal income

---

# Desired System Image

* Different from crowdfunding. We aim to provide an experience with the completed work.
* While the creators are the main focus, we aim to limit the link between addresses and personal information.
* By utilizing the work and its end credits (contract) as intermediaries, we want to implement DeFi's LP and concepts of staking, and claiming.
  * For example, admirers can serve as liquidity providers, and only specific creators can claim rewards.
